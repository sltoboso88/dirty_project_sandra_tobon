# Birds observation

## Explanation of the Data  

The data is a recollection of observations of birds in 10 minutes from different ships.   
We have:  

 * the common, scientific and abreviation name of the species
 * the amount of the same species saw in 10 minutes in count
 * the latitude where the ship did the observation
 * the id of the observation and one id for birds and ships
 
## Clean process  

  * The data set have two tables, one for the birds observation and other for the ships that did the observation, the key that conect both table is record_id  
  * Both data set have a lot columns that have NULLS values and we don't need for answering the questions so we have delete them  
  * We have keeped the columns accompanying_numbers or accompanying_ocurrence, because with them we can analyse if the birds were with accompanying or not at the moment of the view in different way that we do with the count column  
  * Both tables have an unique and numerical id
  * We have droped the NULLS values
  * We have inner join the tibbles by the record_id  
  
## Answers the Questions  

  1. Which bird had the most individual sightings?  
  Note: For answering this question we have answered  with count column and with accompanying_ocurrence
```{r}
birds_ship_data %>%
  group_by(species_scientific_name, species_common_name, species_abbreviation) %>%
  filter(count == 1) %>%
  summarise(number_sightings = sum(count)) %>%
  arrange(desc(number_sightings)) %>%
  head(1)

birds_ship_data %>%
  group_by(species_scientific_name, species_common_name, species_abbreviation) %>%
  filter(count == 1, accompanying_ocurrence == "N") %>%
  summarise(number_sightings = sum(count)) %>%
  arrange(desc(number_sightings)) %>%
  head(1)
```
  
  2. Which bird had the highest total count?
  
```{r}
birds_ship_data %>%
  group_by(species_scientific_name, species_common_name, species_abbreviation) %>%
  summarise(number_total_sightings = sum(count)) %>%
  arrange(desc(number_total_sightings)) %>%
  head(1)
```
  
  3. Which bird had the highest total count above a latitude of -30?
  
```{r}
birds_ship_data %>%
  group_by(species_scientific_name, species_common_name, species_abbreviation) %>%
  filter(lat > -30) %>% 
  summarise(number_total_sightings_30 = sum(count)) %>%
  arrange(desc(number_total_sightings_30)) %>%
  head(1)
```
  
  4. How many different types of birds were only ever seen in groups of 1?
  
```{r}
bird_view_one <- birds_ship_data %>%
  filter(count == 1)

bird_view_more <- birds_ship_data %>%
  filter(count >= 2)

bird_view_one %>%
  anti_join(bird_view_more, by = c("species_scientific_name",
   "species_common_name", "species_abbreviation")) %>%
  group_by(species_scientific_name, species_common_name, species_abbreviation) %>%
  summarise(real_species = n_distinct(species_common_name)) %>% 
  nrow()
```

  5. How many penguins were seen?  
  
```{r}
pattern = "[Pp]enguin"

birds_ship_data %>%
  filter(str_detect(species_common_name, pattern)) %>%
  summarise(total_penguin = sum(count))
```
