Dog Owners Survey.

It have a dimensions of 308 rows and 11 columns
Only the name on the column Title was wrong so we have changed it
It have 3 items that are duplicated one or more time, two one time and one five
times. We have deleted the duplicates.
We have standardize the gender (F, M, unknown, no entry )and size columns
(XS, S, M, L, XL, no entry)
The column age we have transform the values that were writing with words and
convert the column to number,
In the column amount_spent_on_dog_food we also clean some data that weren't
numerical and applied abs so the 2 negative values became positive. Because
doesn't make sense that you spend in food a negative value.
We don't have to much data here so every data is important, so we will not
delete the NA values, we will convert them to No entry value and filter it in
the analysis, so we don't loss too much data.
