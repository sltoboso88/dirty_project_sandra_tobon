# Dog Owners Survey

## Explanation of the Data Set  

This is a "free-hand " survey filled by dog owners. In this survey the owners of the dog answer:  

  * tittle, first_name, last_name, email  
  * amount_spent_on_dog_food, dog_size, dog_gender, dog_age  

## Clean Data Process 

The raw_data have a dimensions of 308 rows and 11 columns.  

  * Only one column had the name different to snake style (Title)  
  * Three rows were duplicates, two one time and one six times, so we have deleted the duplicates  
  * Two rows had information about more that one dog, so we have add some rows with the information of each dog, in this way we have one row per dog  
  * We standardize the columns dog_gender, dog_size  
  * We standardize the columns dog_age and amount_spent_on_dog_food, also we transform them to numeric and convert to positive 
  * We didn't delete NA values, because most of the time the  others columns have valid values that we can use in the analysis
  
## Answer the questions  

  1. The client only counts a valid email address as one ending in ‘.com’. How many survey results have a valid email address  
  
```{r}
dog_survey %>%
  mutate(is_email = str_ends(email, "\\.com")) %>%
  summarise(total_valid_email = sum(is_email))
```
  
  2. The average amount spent on dog food for each dog size  
  
```{r}
dog_survey %>%
  filter(!c(dog_size == "No entry" | is.na(amount_spent_on_dog_food))) %>%
  group_by(dog_size) %>%
  summarise(amount_spent_on_dog_food_per_size = round(mean(amount_spent_on_dog_food),2)) %>%
  arrange(desc(amount_spent_on_dog_food_per_size))
```
  
  
  3. The average age of their dog for owners whose surname starts with a letter in the second half of the alphabet (N onwards)
  
```{r}
pattern <- "[N-Z]"
dog_survey %>%
  mutate(is_n_to_z = str_starts(last_name, pattern)) %>%
  filter(is_n_to_z == TRUE) %>%
  summarise(average_dog_age_n_to_z = round(mean(dog_age),0))
```

  4. The dog_age column is the age in dog years. If the conversion is 1 human year = 6 dog years, then what is the average human age for dogs of each gender?
  
```{r}
dog_survey %>%
  filter(dog_gender != "No entry") %>%
  mutate(human_age_dog = dog_age/6) %>%
  group_by(dog_gender) %>%
  summarise(average_human_age = round(mean(human_age_dog),0))
```
  
  5. Create a plot of results of question 4

```{r}
dog_survey %>%
  filter(dog_gender != "No entry") %>%
  mutate(human_age_dog = dog_age/6) %>%
  group_by(dog_gender) %>%
  summarise(average_human_age = round(mean(human_age_dog),0)) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = dog_gender, y = average_human_age)) +
  geom_histogram(stat = "identity")
```
