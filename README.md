# dirty_project_sandra_tobon

Here are some data cleaning projects that I have done for my course in CodeClan. The projects are in R and I have cleaned the 
data and extracted it in order to derive some insights about the data and what it represents.  

The structure of each project is:

  * raw_data
  * data_cleaning_scripts
  * clean_data
  * analysis_and_documentation
	
The explanation of the cleaning proccess is in a txt file saved inside the folder "data_cleaning_scripts", where you can also 
find the scripts in R that I produced for cleaning the data. The cleaned data itself is saved in a csv file in clean_data. 

The insights about the data are in a html file called ¨documentation_xxx¨(where xxx is the name of each project), saved in 
the folder "analysis_and_documentation". 

Soon I will also analyse the same projects using Python to produce additional plots, insights and explanations.
