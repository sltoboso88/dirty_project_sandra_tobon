## About the data  

The data base is a recollection of different style of disasters reported by year and by country, between 1900 to 2015.   

Some of the countries that we find here don't exist anymore, because they were divided or unified.

In the data base we find information about:  
  
  * year = 1900 - 2015  
  * disaster_type = 17 different disasters type  
  * iso = international id of countries base in three letters   
  * country_name   
  * occurrence = number of times that disaster_type occurred in the year  
  * total_deaths   
  * affected  = people requiring immediate assistance during an emergency situation  
  * injured  = here aren't people that were affected   
  * homeless = people that loss their houses  
  * total_affected  
  * total_damage = the economic loss in USD  
  
##  Cleaning process  

  * Some rows were duplicate but with different id, so we deleted them  
  * We standardize the column disaster_type that has some misspelling rows  
  * It was a country that had more than 3 characters in iso column, we have converted it to the iso standars  
  * Some countries_names had special characters so instead to change their name we have used encode Latin 1. Also we have corrrected the misspelling in some countries_name
  * total_death had a negative value that we have taken out
  * The columns ocurrence, total_death, affected, injured, homeless and total_affected were transform to integer  
  * ocurrence, total_deaths and total_affected had outliers but actually they are real data so we haven't delete them
  * The NA values were repleacing by 0 because we didn't want to lose this data, we will filter them in each specific case  
  * The columns total_affected had a lot missing values, but when we analyze the data we discovered that total_affected was a summation between total_death, affected, injured and homeless columns, so in this way we could fill the missing values in the column total_affected  
  * For answering the questions we don't need the columns affected, injured, homeless and total_damage, so we have taken them out  

## Answer The Questions  

  1. What was the greatest disaster of all time by total deaths?  

  Disaster with the majority of deaths  
  Notes: Soviet famine of 1932â€“33 was a major famine that killed millions of people in the major grain-producing areas in Soviet Union (Ukraine)
```{r}
disasters_clean %>%
  filter(total_deaths == max(total_deaths))
```

  Disaster Type with more deaths  
```{r}
disasters_clean %>%
   group_by(disaster_type) %>%
   summarise(total_deaths_per_disaster_type = sum(total_deaths)) %>%
   arrange(desc(total_deaths_per_disaster_type)) %>%
   top_n(1)
```


  2. Which country has had the highest total people affected by disasters? 
  Note: China is the country with more population, also the labor conditions aren't very safe, so they have a lot Industrial accident with people affected by them.   
```{r}
disasters_clean %>%
  group_by(country_name) %>%
  summarise(total_people_affected_by_disasters = sum(total_deaths)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_people_affected_by_disasters)) %>%
  top_n(1)
```
  
  3. What are the top 5 countries for total number of disasters?
  
```{r}
disasters_clean %>%
  group_by(country_name) %>%
  summarise(total_number_of_disasters = sum(occurrence)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_number_of_disasters)) %>%
  top_n(5)
```

  4. What is the greatest disaster in the last 5 years of the data, by total deaths?
  
  Disaster with the majority of deaths in the last 5 years of the data base
```{r}
disasters_clean %>%
  filter(year > 2010 ) %>%
  filter(total_deaths == max(total_deaths))
```
  

   Disaster Type with more deaths in the last 5 years of the data base
```{r}
disasters_clean %>%
   filter(year > 2010) %>%
   group_by(disaster_type) %>%
   summarise(total_deaths_per_disaster_type = sum(total_deaths)) %>%
   arrange(desc(total_deaths_per_disaster_type)) %>%
   top_n(1)
```


  5. What were the top 10 years that had the most people dying from earthquakes? 
```{r}
disasters_clean %>%
  filter(disaster_type == "Earthquake") %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(total_deaths_by_earthquake = sum(total_deaths)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_deaths_by_earthquake)) %>%
  top_n(10)
```
