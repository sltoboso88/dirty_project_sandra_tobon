DISASTERS DATA CLEANING PROCESS

The dimensions of the raw data set are 12397 rows and 12 columns.

The columns names are accord with snakes parameters.

They are 2 rows that are duplicated but the only way to identify them is
without use the column id because it is unique in each rows. We have deleted
those data.

The column year looks fine

Valid values in the column disasters type:
Drought
Epidemic
Flood
Storm
Volcanic activity
Earthquake
Industrial accident
Miscelleanous accident
Mass Movement (dry)
Transport accident
Landslide
Wildfire
Insect infestation
Extreme Temperature
Impact
Animal Accident
Complex Disasters

The column iso, CHINA is the only data different that 3 characters

names_country column here some names are in Latin1 so we have to chances the
encode configuration to Latin1 and solve come problems with the name of that
countries
Canary Islands = Canary Is
Ivory Coast = C�te d�Ivoire
Réunion  = R?Réunion
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland =
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Irela

The column occurrence have outliers after the value 9 occurrence,  but actually
they are real values, most of them relative to (184):
  Transport accident
  Miscelleanous accident
  Storm
  Flood
  Industrial accident
  Epidemic
  (Earthquake)
If we take the occurrence outliers and analyze the outliers inside outliers we
have only 2 values 52 and 54 relative with Industrial accident in China in 2004
and 2005
I keep the outliers in occurrence because they show the reality
The NA values we transform in 0 so we can work easier with that
total_deaths have 21 outliers, but they looks like real value, so we will keep
them

The column total_affected is an summation of the columns:
  total_deaths
  affected
  injured
  homeless
So the missing values could be filling with a summation of the column above
We have change the NA values for 0 so in that way we can fill the missing values
in total_affected we will filter them in the moment that we will need them
For answering the questions we don't need the columns affected, injured and
homeless so we take them out, but we have used them for filling the missing
values in total_affected.

The values in total_damage are in dollars but we don't need the column
total_damage for answering the questions.

total_affected have 63 outliers but they are real data so we will continue
working with them.

We transform the columns occurrence, total_deaths and total_affected to
integer because they are relative with number of people. Also we have filter
the negative total_deaths value because is clear that it was a mistake.
