## Dechatlon Data  

It is a data base with the times and points of different competitors in two decathlon competitions.   

## Cleaning process  

  * Clean the columns names and change some names in the columns so they will be more meaningful 
  * Convert the row names to a column and standardize the data  
  * Change the column competition to as.character so will be easier to work with it  
  * Select the columns that we will use for answering the questions  
  
## Answer the Question  

  1. Who had the longest long jump seen in the data?   
```{r}
decathlon_clean %>%
  select(broker_name, long_jump) %>%
  filter(long_jump == max(long_jump))
```
  
  2. What was the average 100m time in each competition?  
```{r}
decathlon_clean %>%
  group_by(competition) %>%
  summarise(average_100m_race_per_competition = round(mean(race_100m),2))
```
  
  3. Who had the highest total points across both competitions?  
```{r}
decathlon_clean %>%
  group_by(broker_name) %>%
  summarise(highest_total_points_both_competitions = sum(points)) %>%
  arrange(desc(highest_total_points_both_competitions)) %>%
  top_n(1)
```
  
  4. What was the shot-put scores for the top three competitors in each competition?  
```{r}
decathlon_clean %>%
  select(competition, rank, shot_put) %>%
  filter(rank < 4)
```

  Total points in shot-put for the top three competitors in each competition  
```{r}
decathlon_clean %>%
  select(competition, rank, shot_put) %>%
  filter(rank < 4) %>%
  group_by(competition) %>%
  summarise(total_points_shot_put = sum(shot_put))
```

  5. What was the average points for competitors who ran the 400m in less than 50 seconds vs. those than ran 400m in more than 50 seconds?  
```{r}
seconds_400_50 <- c(50.1)

decathlon_clean %>%
  arrange(race_400m) %>%
  mutate(group_400m = findInterval(race_400m, seconds_400_50)) %>%
  mutate_at("group_400m", as.character) %>%
  mutate(group_400m = recode(group_400m,
                             '0' = "less_50_400m",
                             '1' = "more_50_400m")) %>%
  group_by(group_400m) %>%
  summarise(average_points_400m = round(mean(race_400m),2))
```
