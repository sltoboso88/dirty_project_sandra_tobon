Dechatlon Data
It has 41 rows and 13 columns
The columns names aren't in snake style and some names aren't really
informative so we have clean and rename the columns names
The rows have names that we will need for the analyze so they should be a new
column call broker_name
The names in broker_name are writing in different styles so we transform them
with a title style
We chance the competition column from factor to character so it will be easier
work with it
For answering the questions I will need the following columns:
* broker_name
* race_100m
* long_jump
* shot_put
* race_400m
* rank
* points
* competition
